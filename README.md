######## Android Application #########
Open the project in android studio and click on Run App. The app will open in a emulator. Alternatively you can connect an android device with usb debugging enabled.

You can also run the app-debug.apk using the `adb install app-debug.apk` command from the file directory.

######## Google App Engine #########

Deploy the application in Google App Engine. It is easier to deploy it using a Cloud Tool Plugin in intellij. The same task 
can be done using the gcloud client tool. 

Create the app.yaml and deploy it to the Google App Engine after authenticating your google cloud account using the Cloud Tool Plugin.
